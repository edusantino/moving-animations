# Lua Animations & Experiments

A playful repository for experimenting with animations using **Lua + Love2D**.  
Here I explore different easing functions (like easeIn, easeOut), transitions, and motion effects â€” just for fun! ðŸŽ¨

## What's Inside?
- Simple animation experiments
- Easing function tests (using learp or similar)
- Interactive demos
- Code snippets for smooth motions

## Requirements
- [LÃ–VE (Love2D)](https://love2d.org/) framework
- Lua familiarity (optional, just for curiosity)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Drag and drop the project folder onto `love.exe`
3. Or run via terminal:
   ```bash
   love /path/to/project
